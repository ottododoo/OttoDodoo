Hello, I'm Otto, originally from Ghana and now based in Germany. With a background in policy analysis and project management, I'm excited to transition into data analysis.

I bring expertise in research, project coordination, and partnership development, eager to apply my skills in data processing, visualization, and statistical analysis. I'm driven to uncover insights and support strategic decision-making in a dynamic, data-driven environment.
