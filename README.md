Hello, I'm Otto, originally from Ghana and currently based in Germany. I'm an enthusiastic and analytical person with a background in policy analysis and project management.

I may be new to the tech industry, but my dedication and knack for analysis has been honed through my previous experiences. I'm eager to apply my skills to a career in data analysis, using my expertise in research, project coordination and partnership development.

I'm particularly excited to apply my burgeoning skills in data processing, visualisation and statistical analysis to uncover insights and support strategic decision-making in a dynamic and data-driven environment.
